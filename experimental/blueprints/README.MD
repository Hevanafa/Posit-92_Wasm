This document focuses on what the biggest friction and what tripped me the most when building

Examples included:

- **Movements** uses scancodes & zones

- **Proximity** needs movement, zones, and distance calculation

- **Map objects** modifies the movement behaviour

**The goal** is to make it easier to work on the content pipeline some time in the future

The asset loading part can be skipped, assuming the user knows what they're doing

This makes understanding the logic easier by **copying & adapting** instead of having to think & write the code from scratch

This is kinda like **leaving traces & hints** to solve problems that appear often, instead of having to think from nothing, starting all over again
